### SDN Controller
The centralized monitoring of the wireless mesh network is performed with the following scripts:

```
./getNodes.sh           # collect information about the network nodes
./getOriginators.sh     # collect the best originators
```

To execute the additional Controller features run:

```
python3 controller.py
```
