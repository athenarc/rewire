# REWIRE: Experimenting with SDN-based Adaptable Non-IP Protocol Stacks in Smart-City Environments


![REWIRE project overview](/rewire.jpg)

## Description

REWIRE tackles scalability and reliability issues in Smart-Cities through an SDN-based management platform that mixes-and-matches, on-demand, multiple Non-IP protocol strategies with real (i) rapidly-detected network conditions, and (ii) IoT data communication patterns.

In this repository we provide the main scripts of the REWIRE project including:
