  <h1 align="center">Experimenting with SDN-based Adaptable Non-IP Protocol Stacks in Smart-City Environments (REWIRE)</h1>
  <br />
</p>

# Description

REWIRE tackles scalability and reliability issues in Smart-Cities through an SDN-based management platform that mixes-and-matches, on-demand, multiple Non-IP protocol strategies with real (i) rapidly-detected network conditions, and (ii) IoT data communication patterns.

In this repository we provide the main scripts of the REWIRE project including:

* The SDN Controller implementation.
* The Network Nodes scripts and protocol configuration files.
* An easy-to-use bash script for NDN configuration.

# Example
The network deployments in the REWIRE project include:

* The SDN Controller: Instructions about running the implemented SDN Controller can be found [here](/controller/README.md) 
* The Network Nodes: Instructions about running the Network Nodes can be found [here](/nodes/README.md)
