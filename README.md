# REWIRE: Experimenting with SDN-based Adaptable Non-IP Protocol Stacks in Smart-City Environments


![REWIRE project overview](/rewire.jpg)

## Description

REWIRE tackles scalability and reliability issues in Smart-Cities through an SDN-based management platform that mixes-and-matches, on-demand, multiple Non-IP protocol strategies with real (i) rapidly-detected network conditions, and (ii) IoT data communication patterns.

In this repository we provide the main scripts of the REWIRE project including:

* The SDN-controller implementation
* The Network Nodes scripts and protocol configuration files
* An easy-to-use bash script for NDN configuration

## Example
The network deployments in the REWIRE project include:

**The SDN Controller: Instructions about running the implemented SDN Controller can be found at Readme file [here](/controller/README.md) 
**The Network Nodes: Instructions about running the Network Nodes can be found at Readme file [here](/nodes/README.md)
